# This script creates and then takes the DB and media files of the netbox docker container and dumbs them either on the network share (if mounted) or on an internal path.
# Additionally, it checks if there are backups older than 7 days and removes them. /home/netbox/bin/netboxExportHistory.txt and /mnt/netbox_db_dumb/netboxExportHistory.txt contain events.
 
# To-Do:
# - Mount your desired network share at '/mnt/netbox_db_dumb'.
# - Adjust script and storage paths to you desired locations.
# - Change retention period if needed.
# - Make sure to set a cron job according to your needs.
# - Check if the script works incl. retention period.
